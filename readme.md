📘 Book Store App
📌 Project Overview

The Book Store App is a web-based application that allows users to register, log in, and browse books online. The application provides access to both free books and restricted (purchased) books, where access is controlled through user authentication and permissions rather than real payment processing.

This project is developed as part of a Web Development course to demonstrate full-stack application concepts.

👤 Target Users

Users (Customers):
Customers can create an account, log in, browse available books, access free books, and view purchased books based on access permissions.

Administrators:
Administrators manage book content and control access permissions for restricted books.

✨ Key Features

User registration, login, and logout

Access to free books for all users

Access to restricted (purchased) books based on permissions

Book content management by administrators

Secure data storage using a database

🔐 Purchase and Access Model (Important)

This application does not include real payment processing.
The concept of “purchase” is simulated and used only to demonstrate access control and authorization. Integration of real payment gateways is considered a future enhancement.

🧱 System Architecture

The Book Store App follows a client–server–database architecture:

The frontend provides the user interface for browsing books and managing accounts

The backend handles authentication, authorization, and application logic

The database stores user data, book information, and access permissions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB
